    <p>Using 3d software our engineers and designers will draw up and design your concept. They will guide you in using GD&T, the static and dynamics of mechanical engineering in what will work and what wonâ€™t work. They will then provide you with an engineer drawing with all the dimensions of your part. They will also do a 3d rendering of your product.</p>
